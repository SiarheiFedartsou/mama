MaMa(from **Ma**p **Ma**tcher) library implements realtime map matcher with a target to be able to run on both backend and mobile. 

## Demo 
See our [demo](./demo).

## Credits
Map matching algorithm itself is mainly inspired by "classic" Microsoft paper [`Hidden Markov Map Matching Through Noise and Sparseness`](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/map-matching-ACM-GIS-camera-ready.pdf).
