MaMa (short for Map Matcher) is a library that lets you perform real-time map matching of locations coming from multiple clients as part of distributed system (but in its core it is just a library which can easily be used locally). Main target of MaMa is blazingly fast performance.

##  Quick start & Demo 

Here is example how one can configure and run `mama` map matching service for Berlin:
```
mkdir tiles
cd tiles
# download OSM data
wget http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany/berlin-latest.osm.pbf
# generate mama tiles
docker run -t -v $(pwd):/tiles ghcr.io/siarheifedartsou/mama:main tilegen /tiles/berlin-latest.osm.pbf /tiles
# run mama-server
docker run -t -p 50051:50051 -v $(pwd):/tiles ghcr.io/siarheifedartsou/mama:main mama_server /tiles 
```

This service exposes API via [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), so you have to use gRPC client to access it(see [mama.proto](https://github.com/SiarheiFedartsou/mama/blob/main/server/mama.proto) for service definition). For test purposes it can be done with [`grpc_cli`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/command_line_tool.md):

```
grpc_cli call localhost:50051 Match "entries: [{location: {latitude: 52.517037, longitude: 13.388860}}]"
```

See our [demo](./demo) for example of real life usage.

## How it works

#### `tilegen`

In order to work `mama` preprocess OSM data to more convenient representation. `tilegen` is a tool used for that.

`tilegen` takes `.osm.pbf` as input and slices it to tiles. Tile scheme corresponds to level 11 of [S2Geometry](https://s2geometry.io/), i.e. has approximately 20 km^2 in area:

Each tile stores metadata about road graph edges accessible by cars in particular area and [S2 index](https://s2geometry.io/devguide/s2shapeindex.html) which allows to effectively find projections on road graph. 

`tilegen` also optionally precomputes shortest paths used in map matching algorithm, which significantly boosts runtime performance. 

#### `libmama`
`libmama` is C++ library implementing core features of `mama`. [`mama_server`](https://github.com/SiarheiFedartsou/mama/blob/cb15123ca81d6712f2cccff06cc842a1b6e2b9ce/server/mama_server.cc#L57) can be a good example of how it should be used. 

#### `mama_server`
`mama_server` is gRPC service which wraps `libmama` and provides map matching capabilities to external clients. This service doesn't store any state and it is responsibility of clients to store map matching states(see [demo](./demo) for example how Redis can be used for that purpose). 


## Credits
- Map matching algorithm itself is mainly inspired by "classic" Microsoft paper [`Hidden Markov Map Matching Through Noise and Sparseness`](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/map-matching-ACM-GIS-camera-ready.pdf).
- Shortest paths precomputation is inspired by [`Fast map matching, an algorithm integrating hidden
Markov model with precomputation`](https://people.kth.se/~cyang/bib/fmm.pdf) paper.
